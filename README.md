Vehicle Transition

i. This project is centered around finding a way to simulate CO2-emissions changes over time with the ongoing combustion-to-electric vehicle transition. I will make a model that takes into acount various factors concerning the transition, ranging from vehicle usage and battery production, to mining of the necessary rare earth minerals.

ii. For this project, I will definitively use the following libraries (and possibly more): pandas, numpy, csv and matplotlib (or plotly). As for methods, I am thinking of using time series processing and maybe differential equations to be able to predict emission rates and identify trends.

iii. I will need a lot of data for this project. Data on current vehicle types, average fuel consumptions, CO2 emissions from combustion, CO2 emissions from electric engine production, etc.

iv. The expected outcome for this project is to see a certain decrease in CO2-emissions concerning the vehicle sector over time. If not, this would be a bad sign of what is tome come...
